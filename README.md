    Performance. Oculus should fully utilize your graphics card when paired with optimization mods like Rubidium.
    Mod compatibility. Oculus should make a best effort to be compatible with modded environments.
    Backwards compatibility. All existing ShadersMod / OptiFine shader packs should just work on Iris, without any modifications required.
    A well-organized codebase. I'd like for working with Iris code to be a pleasant experience overall.
